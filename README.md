# alien-cursors ðŸ›¸
An alien and UFO themed cursor pack for hyprcursor.

## How to Use
1. Git clone this repository into one of the suitable hyprcursor directories e.g. _**'$HOME/.local/share/icons'**_ or simply _**'$HOME/.icons'**_
2. Within your hyprland config, set the theme as follows (set your desired size):  
   ```env = HYPRCURSOR_THEME,alien-cursors```  
   ```env = HYPRCURSOR_SIZE,32```
3. Restart hyprland entirely (unfortunately `hyprctl reload` is not enough).

## Credits
All cursors within this theme are made and maintained by me, and you are free to use them in accordance with the **'MIT license'**. The cursors have already been converted from the original **'SVG'** format into the required **'HLC'** format, using the hyprcursor-util tool. You do not need to do this yourself.
